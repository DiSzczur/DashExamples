# Dash Examples

This is the effort to introduce to use Dash with Python to build dashboard for business intelligence purpose. 

## Good Reasons to build dashboard with Dash

### Open-source Tool
It is free. BI tools like Tableau or Microsoft Power BI are great but they are costly to operate. Dash is a good alternative tool to provide a similar quality and experience with no cost. 

### Great Appearance
The quality of the visualization in Dash or Plotly is very high that is comparable with d3 and Tableau charts. 

### Integrated with Plotly
Plotly is one of the great open source visualization package in the Python library. Many Python developers use Plotly for data visualization. As a product of Plotly, Dash allows developers to integrate their Plotly visualization on the Dash dashboard. Dash is a tool to make building dashboard using Plotly graph easier.

### Easy to use
Although the dashboard is viewed in a web broswer, it is a high level tool that developers are only required to write in Python with some understanding of html. It means no Javascript or d3 is needed to be written to produce the same product. 

### Integrated with Flask
Dash runs web server in Flask. No need to set up in Flask, easy to host the web server in AWS. No need to be web programmer to build the dashboard.

## Tutorial and Examples
